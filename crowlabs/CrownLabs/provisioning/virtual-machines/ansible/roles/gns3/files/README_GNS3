In order to complete the setup of GNS3, it is necessary to manually perform
some additional operations. Most importantly, you have to own a valid Cisco
IOS image, that needs to be imported in GNS3 and made available through the
creation of a new template.

The complete instructions for the setup of GNS3 as used for the networking
laboratories at Politecnico di Torino are available on a private GitHub repository:
